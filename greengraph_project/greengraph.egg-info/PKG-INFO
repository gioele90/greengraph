Description: GREENGRAPH 0.1
        ==============
        
        This software uses the geopy library to get satellite images of a number of locations,
        counts the number of green pixels in each of them and produces the corresponding graph.
        The graph gives an rough estimate of how the amount of greenland changes from one place
        to another.
        
        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        To install the program, move to the greengraph_project folder with the terminal or Command
        Prompt and run the code
        
        python setup.py install
        
        On Mac/Linux root access might be required, in which case do
        
        sudo python setup.py install
        
        On Windows the Command Prompt should be opened with administrator privileges.
        
        RUN THE PROGRAM
        ---------------
        
        The appropriate invocation to run this program is:
        
        python -m greengraph --start [START] --stop [STOP] --steps [STEPS] --out [OUT]
        
        where [START] is the name of the initial location (such as New York), [STOP] is the final
        location, [STEPS] is the number of steps between start and stop and [OUT] is the name of
        the output picture.
